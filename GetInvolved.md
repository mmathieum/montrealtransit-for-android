The development of this application has started **months ago** and we work on this project on a **voluntary** basis on our **free** time.

This project allows us to satisfy our curiosity as a developer, to help the users and to highlight the capabilities of the Android platform.

# How can you help? #

  * As a **user**, you can report a problem or ask for a new feature [here](http://code.google.com/p/montrealtransit-for-android/issues/entry).

  * As a **user**, you can look at the list of [known issues](http://code.google.com/p/montrealtransit-for-android/issues/list?q=type=Defect) and [feature requests](http://code.google.com/p/montrealtransit-for-android/issues/list?q=type=Enhancement) to add your comments.

  * As a **developer** or if you're interested by Android apps development, you can get [the source code](http://code.google.com/p/montrealtransit-for-android/source) and start to look at it.
> Then, if you want to fix [an issue](http://code.google.com/p/montrealtransit-for-android/issues/list?q=type=Defect) or add a [new feature](http://code.google.com/p/montrealtransit-for-android/issues/list?q=type=Enhancement), you should inform us (to avoid working on the same thing unnecessarily).
> When you've made the necessary changes in the source code, you will need to contact us to get write access on the project source code.

  * As a **graphic** artist, you can help us by providing new images for the application.
> You can find existing images [here](http://code.google.com/p/montrealtransit-for-android/source/browse/#svn/trunk/MonTransit/res/drawable) and [here](http://code.google.com/p/montrealtransit-for-android/source/browse/#svn/trunk/MonTransit/res/drawable-hdpi).

  * As a **wireless carrier** or as an Android **device manufacturer**, you can help us by providing test devices to polish the compatibility of the application with your devices in order to improve your customers experience.
